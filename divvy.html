          <h3>UX RESEARCH • BRANDING • PROTOTYPING • USABILITY TESTING</h3>
          <h2>The simple money app that sets your daily spending allowance, stays on top of your bills, and helps you save with ease.</h2>
          <div class="paragraphBlock">
            <p>Rent is coming up, bills are due, and friends want to go out, but payday isn’t until next friday! Struggling to balance these finances can be destabilizing, and traditional budgets won’t help when you’re already too busy in the first place. <br>
            <br>
          Divvy generates a Daily Savings Allowance giving users a simple and flexible spending guideline, instead of laboring over constricting budgets. With better control over their spending, users can stash away extra money for whatever they might need.</p>

                <p>Deployed a survey investigating how people manage their finances & budgeting, garnering 70 respondents. Found that 75% of respondents don’t consistently use a budget, citing too much work, inability to commit to a budget, or not having enough money in the first place.
                <br><p>
                90% would however use a budgeting/finance app if it worked for them, which would depend on ease of use and flexibility. Their predominant priorities were increasing their savings and avoiding overdraft fees. 81% of respondents thought a dollar-amount spending limit per day would be useful. The product could easily generate this number with some banking information, not requiring heavy user input the way a classical budget would.</p></div></div>

                <p>However the app Qapital has simple savings features that would work well for many of the respondents. Cleo is an automated chatbot that works through Facebook messenger. It proactively takes the driver’s seat and prompts the users into action, who can react at their leisure or not at all. The target demographic’s needs could really be served by a product incorporating the savings feature and messaging styles of the aforementioned products.

              <p>I sketched out ideas of these main features to get an idea of how they could fit together. The starting point was a home-screen / dashboard with just the highest priority features (user’s account balance and spending limit). A bottom navigation bar would allow the user to navigate to the other sections (bill/income & savings).</p>

            <h5>WIREFRAMES</h5>
            <p>After sketching several iterations of the dashboard, bills section, savings section, and icons that allow the user to navigate through the app, these drawings were moved into a digital format using the Whimsical app. This provided a concrete sense of how the content would fit into screens and the hierarchy would be structured. Certain screens featured multiple monetary values, which was potentially overwhelming to the target user. I assembled the wireframes into a <a href="https://marvelapp.com/habjhee"target="_blank">rough prototype</a>, to informally test and see how users navigate and interpret the content.

              <p>The tester was able to navigate through most screens, pausing to evaluate the text as she went. She was confused by “Add these to know when your Spending Allowance will reset”, which in retrospect is poorly written. Either the language or the timing of that information needed adjustment, or possibly both. In that instance, the explanation was scrapped, since the research data showed the users’ need for brevity rather than lengthy explanations.

              <p><br>With the app’s layout and basic hierarchy set up in wireframes, the project could move into the visual design stage. It would need to be simple, open and inviting for the target user.</p>
              <h5>TYPOGRAPHY</h5>
              <p>Rubik was chosen as the app’s typeface because its friendly simplicity mixed, easy legibility and confident authority befitting of a finance app (it beat out other similar candidates with its clear and unadorned numerals).
              </p>
            </div>

              <h5>LOGO DESIGN</h5>
              <p>I mindmapped the app’s concepts to find a catchy title, and one that metaphorically fit was “Divvy”— splitting up the rest of your money— into a budget or savings. An already existing product of the same name deals with business budgets and expenses, with a logotype style similar to what I had been considering. Both to separate from that existing brand and to speak toward a consumer audience, the logo was made with a thicker lineweight and softer edges.<br> See the <a href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/tests/15de8210b2b5/results/bc1a9a1782ac"target="_blank">preference tests for the logo finalists.</p>

            <h5>MOCKUPS</h5>
            <p>Applying the colors, logo and typefaces I designed the different screens focusing on legibility, lightness, and open space. I experimented with wider outside margins, in an attempt to present unintimidating and simplified information, while still maximizing the limited screenspace of a mobile device. I inserted a set of bold secondary colors to keep the designs fresh and youthful.  Check out the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/U2lEIyeMYLTuxQYVvHRzcw/Divvy-1.0-Screens?node-id=0%3A1"target="_blank">first round of hi-fidelity mockups</a> here.<br><br>
            After several rounds of revisions, including reviews with senior designers, I revamped the designs to maintain consistency from screen to screen. I wanted to make sure users weren't distracted by jarring shifts in color or text placement.</p>

            <h4>FINDINGS</h4>
            <div class="backgroundWrapper">
              <p>The Daily Spending Allowance was well received by initial test subjects, but overall its utility was crowded by the Stash and Forecast features. Better examples of how it could benefit users would be valuable. Also testing the app with real user data (balances and bills input by the user themselves) would be a great way to get feedback.</p>

              <h5>TAKEAWAYS</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Frequent and constant testing at any stage of the design-- but especially during the Wireframe stages where more levels of revision could take place. </li>
                <li>Designing for simplicity is anything but! Accounting for users with low literacy and attention spans means paring down and eliminating anything but the essentials. The next evolution of Divvy will likely see removal of the least useful elements for the user’s ease of consumption.</li>
                <li>Money issues are private and touchy! Not everyone wants to share this type of information, or become stressed out by it, which presents research challenges.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>LOOKING AHEAD</h5>
              <p>Going forward the Forecast feature needs the most scrutiny–will users find value in it? Even with improvements to the design and function of it, it will only      truly work if users are getting something out of it.<br><br>
              Next up is more user testing, exploring other similar products and their approach, and find ways to communicate the product idea and efficiently guide the user to financial stability. Once this research is further refined, I plan to create a web browser landing page that more broadly explains the product features with animated illustrations and text, with an App-Store call-to-action linking to the mobile prototype.
