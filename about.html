      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <h2>I’ve been becoming a designer for a long time. Here’s how my passions and experiences have brought me where I am today.</h2>
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rQ2ggqYqQFxaCD7eWsvu_xkQ3GypmEzO/view?usp=sharing">      <input class="resumeButton" type="button" value="résumé">
            <div class="backgroundWrapper"></a>



        <p>Growing up, I’d fill sketchbooks with X-Men drawings, endlessly pour over the instructional booklet to my new video game, and craft home-made VHS packaging of my favorite sci-fi movies. This is a) because I’m a huge nerd, and b) what I attribute to my innate interest in design. How visual media blasts so much information straight to your cerebral cortex, imbuing everyday objects into tapestries of history and wonder.</p>
        <h6>EXPLORING MY TALENTS</h6>
        <p>I pursued my artistic talents and studied fine arts, exploring strict styles of realism in painting and drawing. But eventually it turned out something was missing (not just money). I wanted more analysis, more rationale, more of a concrete goal. Then I lucked into a role as print designer for a women’s shoe company. As I figured out the job on the fly, I fell in love with typography - only this time logging hours with Adobe Illustrator rather than Kidpix and MS Paint. I never quite got the hang of fashion magazines, but I refined my skills as a visual communicator. </p>
        <h6>CHANGE OF PACE</h6>
        <p>After relocating in a tough job market, I took up art framing - a secretly grueling world of coming up with designs on the fly, refining processes, keeping promises on tough deadlines, and delivering on projects in which people put their trust in you. Not the most glamorous gig, but this was the cauldron where I really learned to be patient, listen, and really understand where people are coming from and what they are trying to achieve. Above all I got to deliver them the final product and share in the success (and sometimes go back to the drawing board).
        <br><br>
        This is what was missing– collaborating with others, constructively hashing out the problem, and providing solutions using my skills and point of view. I felt firsthand how design could take a problem, flip it on its head, and ultimately create a sharable experience with others, and how positively that can impact people’s lives.</p>
        <h6>SCALING UP</h6>
        <p>Now I’m ready to scale up - I’m studying User Experience Design through Bloc’s comprehensive program, so I can work on projects that make a difference in people’s lives; whether that’s streamlining business interactions, improving people's’ access to healthcare and public services, or just helping pick the right cheese to bring to the dinner party. Let me know if you are interested in working together.
